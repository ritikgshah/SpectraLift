# SpectraLift: Physics-Guided Spectral-Inversion Network for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Ritik Shah, Marco Duarte

Welcome to the official implementation of SpectraLift. This repository accompanies our research paper and includes code, notebooks, data outputs, and environment files used for experimentation and analysis

## Repository Contents:
- CSV files with metrics
  Contains subfolders for each synthetic hyperspectral image (HSI): Botswana, Kennedy Space Center, Pavia Center, Pavia University, and Washington DC Mall.
  Each subfolder includes CSV files listing image quality metrics for multiple experimental settings—e.g., different PSFs, downsampling ratios for low-resolution HSI, and varying numbers of bands in high-resolution MSI.
  Additionally, the root folder includes an Excel file titled All SOTA methods comparison for all experiments, which aggregates all individual metrics and comparison tables. These results reflect all synthetic experiment data reported in our paper.
- Comparison Implementation
  Contains two subfolders:
  • Supervised — Includes pre-executed Jupyter notebooks for FeINFN, FusFormer, GuidedNet, and MIMO-SST, applied to both     synthetic datasets and University of Houston data.
  • Unsupervised — Includes pre-executed notebooks for MIAE, C2FF, SSSR, and SDP.
  These implementations enable benchmarking against state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models.
- Conda Environment Replication Files
  Includes environment setup resources to help users recreate the library environment:
  • requirements.txt — Use this to install dependencies via pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
  • spectralift-env.yaml — Use this to create the Conda environment: 
      conda env create -f spectralift-env.yaml
      conda activate spectralift-env
  Note: In rare cases, the YAML file may not rebuild the environment correctly. We recommend using requirements.txt if issues arise.
- SpectraLift Ablation Study Jupyter Notebooks
  Contains pre-executed notebooks for evaluating the contribution of individual modules and architectural choices in the SpectraLift model.
- SpectraLift Implementation Jupyter Notebooks
  Provides pre-executed notebooks showcasing the full implementation of SpectraLift on synthetic datasets and the University of Houston dataset.
- Super_Resolved_Images_Comparison_Jupyter_Notebooks
  Includes pre-executed notebooks for visualizing the high-resolution HSI outputs generated by SpectraLift and comparison methods.
  Each notebook contains spectral plots and image comparisons. Due to extensive output, Botswana is split across two notebooks.

## Reproducibility:
To ensure reproducibility:
- All notebooks are pre-executed so that researchers can directly view our results without needing to re-run experiments.
- Environment files are provided to recreate the exact setup for running or modifying any notebook.
